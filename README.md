# QuoIntelligence
Founded in February 2020, [QuoIntelligence](https://quointelligence.eu/) has an established presence in the EU and US markets.  We are a threat intelligence partner committed to informing decision-makers of current and prospected cyber and geopolitical threats by providing Finished Intelligence, tailor-made for your organization. We use the term Finished Intelligence because we are not another data or information feed provider.

Our multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural team provides full contextual analyses to produce Intelligence and better enable decision-makers with prioritization and mitigation. By prioritizing customer requirements, we ensure our products are customer-centric, close real security gaps, support risk management, facilitate early detection, answer regulators, and more.
